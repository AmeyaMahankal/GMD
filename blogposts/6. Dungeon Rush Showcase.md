## Introduction
In this blog post we will showcase the different parts of our game. The main objective is to present all aspects of the game, from level design, to combat, to the enemy behavior.

For the level design we wanted the player to feel claustrophobic. We wanted a more horror feel for the game, so we decided to make a maze for the player to traverse.
