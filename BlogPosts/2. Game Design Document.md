## Detailed & Game Systems Design.
**Stealth System.**

Players can move quietly by crouching. Making noise (like running) alerts enemies, who have a detection cone. Stealth kills can be performed from behind without detection. If spotted, players can hide or flee using the environment for cover.

**Combat System**.

Combat is fast and tactical, with light and heavy weapons. Players can attack or block, and armor affects speed and defense. Light weapons are good for stealth and speed, while heavier weapons are more powerful but slower.

**Score System.**

Points are earned for killing enemies, finding collectibles, and escaping quickly. Stealthy play rewards bonus points for avoiding detection and silent takedowns, while aggressive play rewards combat kills. The faster the player escapes, the higher the score. The score is tallied at the end, encouraging replayability and competition on the leaderboards.

###  Core Loops:
**Loop 1:** Overcome enemies through stealth or direct confrontation.
Cycle:
- Assess enemy patrol routes and positioning.
- Decide between stealth takedown, combat, or avoiding detection.
- If detected, either engage or hide until enemies lose 
- Adapt based on enemy behavior and dungeon layout.

**Loop: 2** Accumulate points and rewards to increase replayability.
Cycle:
- Collect treasures and artifacts for points.
- Eliminate enemies for additional score.
- Escape quickly to maximize bonus points.
- Track and compare runs to improve efficiency.

**Loop: 3** Improve your effectiveness through better equipment and playstyle adaptation.
Cycle:
- Find or loot weapons & armor that impact stealth and combat.
- Make trade-offs: heavier gear = more defense but less mobility; lighter gear = better stealth but more vulnerability.

## Milestones:

### Milestone 1: Gameplay: The gameplay has two approaches:
 - Stealthy approach where the player has to sneak around and take out the enemy to progress
 - Brute approach where the player can go all out and kill the enemy en masse.
### Milestone 2: Enemy A.I: 
The enemy will have a pre arranged rout, they will come out of said rout if the player is detected, then they will either rush toward the player, or if the player managed to hide for 5 seconds, then the enemy will give up and go back to it’s pre arranged guarding rout
### Milestone 3: Environment: 
The game will be from a top down bird perspective, where the player will view their avatar from a 3rd person perspective.The environment will consist of dungeons that contain obstacles and enemies that the player must deal with in whatever approach they choose to play the game.
