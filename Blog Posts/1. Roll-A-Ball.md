# Improving the Roll-a-Ball Unity Game Tutorial
We tried to expand on the base game by adding some new mechanics that we though would be fun: **a freeze obstacle**, **moving collectibles**, **jumping**, and **better dying system**. These mechanics make the game at the very least more dynamic.

## Freeze Obstacle
To make the game more challenging, we introduced an obstacle that slows down upon collision. This adds a new layer of difficulty, requiring players to carefully maneuver around. To provide feedback to the player, we also changed the player’s color to indicate that the freeze effect is active.

We did this by creating a new prefab 'FreezeObstacle' and tagging it with "Freeze"

```
 private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
 {

     if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("PickUp"))
     {
         other.gameObject.SetActive(false);
         count++;
         speed += speedIncrementer;
         updateCountText();
     }
     else if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Freeze")) 
     {
         StartCoroutine(TemporarilyImmobilize(1.5f));
     }
 }
```

When a collision is detected we execute a coroutine that slows the player down.

```
private IEnumerator TemporarilyImmobilize(float duration)
{
    isImmobilized = true;
    GetComponent<Renderer>().material = immobilizedMaterial;
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(duration);
    GetComponent<Renderer>().material = normalMaterial;
    isImmobilized = false;
}
```

## Moving Collectibles
To make the environment feel more dynamic and chaotic, we added moving obstacles and collectibles. We got the idea from the Enemy object, so we used Unity’s NavMesh for pathfinding and ensured that collectible items are zooming through the playable space in random directions.



The collectibles continuously select random locations within a specified radius and move toward them. Once they reach their destination, they pick a new random point and move again, ensuring unpredictable movement.


```
    Vector3 GetRandomPoint(Vector3 center, float radius)
    {
        Vector3 randomDirection = Random.insideUnitSphere * radius;
        randomDirection += center;
        NavMeshHit hit;
        if (NavMesh.SamplePosition(randomDirection, out hit, radius, NavMesh.AllAreas))
        {
            return hit.position;
        }
        return center;
    }
```

```
  void Update()
  {
      if (!agent.pathPending && agent.remainingDistance < 0.5f)
      {
          MoveToRandomLocation();
      }
  }

  void MoveToRandomLocation()
  {
      Vector3 randomPoint = GetRandomPoint(transform.position, moveRadius);
      agent.SetDestination(randomPoint);
  }
```

## Jumping
Rolling is fun and all, but jumping adds more control and fun to the game, most importantly it adds more chaos We modified the player’s movement script to allow jumping using the space bar.

To implement this, we started by introducing two variables. `isGrounded` which would tell us if the player is on the ground and `jumpForce` to control how powerful the jump is

`private bool isGrounded`

`public float jumpForce = 2.0f`

`isGrounded` is updated in the `FixedUpdate` together with the movement to ensure consistency. We used `Physics.Raycast` to check if the player is on the ground before allowing them to jump. This prevents mid-air jumps. A Raycast is like an invisible laser beam that extends from a point in a specific direction to detect objects in its path.

```isGrounded = Physics.Raycast(transform.position, Vector3.down, 0.5f);```

If the ray detects a surface below the player within 0.5f units, `isGrounded` is set to true. Otherwise, it's false, preventing jumping while in the air.
Then we added a new `OnJump` action to our player controller bound to the Spacebar. Every time the player presses the Spacebar the `OnJump` event is fired.

```
void OnJump()
 {
     if (isGrounded) // Only allow jump if the player is grounded
     {
         Debug.Log("Jump");
         rb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
     }
 }
```
We used addForce on the rigid body of the player to apply sudden upward force instantly and create a jump. ...And Voila, we have jumping.

## Fast and Faster

Another way to introduce more chaos is to add acceleration. This would make the game progressively harder as the player collects more items and gains speed.

We achieved this by adding a speedIncrementer
```public float speedIncrementer = 2;```

Which we use when we detect a collision with the collectibles. We also update the UI, but that code is not that interesting ;)
```
 private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
 {

     if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("PickUp"))
     {
         other.gameObject.SetActive(false);
         count++;
         speed += speedIncrementer;
         updateCountText();
     }
     else if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Freeze")) 
     {
         StartCoroutine(TemporarilyImmobilize(1.5f));
     }
 }
```

Thanks to all the chaos introduced by us the player can now die also by falling of the map. To do that we compare a custom set `fallThreshould` with the `transform.position.y` of the player and we decide the player should be killed. 




```
public float fallThreshold = -10.0f;


 private void FixedUpdate()
 {
     if (!isImmobilized) 
     {
         Vector3 movement = new Vector3(movementX, 0.0f, movementY);
         rb.AddForce(movement * speed);
     }
     isGrounded = Physics.Raycast(transform.position, Vector3.down, 0.5f);


     if (transform.position.y < fallThreshold)
     {
         Die();
     }
 }
```
