## Introduction
The objective of this milestone was to create the map and environment with a design that would make sense from a top-down third person pesepective which would allow the player to see the area an enemies clearly.

To build the environment, we wanted to create out environment using blender but we struggled with the controls and quickly opted for scouring the asset store in order to find assests that could match out game's style and mood.

Eventually we settled on Lite Dungeon Pack - Low Poly 3D Art by Gridness Studio which has modular prefabs which also came with some environmental props that overall made a decent looking code.
